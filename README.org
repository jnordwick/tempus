*Purpose*

This is a small library for dealing with time. It focus on performance over features with a solid, basic API.

- It uses Cassio Neri's Gregorian Calendar Dates with some small modifications (research paper link in the source)
- has simple cloocks that use clock_gettime underneath
- has clocks that either RDTSC or RDTSCP
- RDTSC fruequency and epoch offset calculation so they can be used for datetimes as a clock_gettime replacement
- fast timestamp generation (format is hardcoded for now to YYYY-MM-DDThh:mm:ss.nnnnnnnnn).
- everything deals with nanoseconds instead of the (second, nanosecond) pair that is common purely for performance.

**Things I'm working on**

- using euclidean affine functions for the divmod operations (wich such limited range I can prob do better than the compiler)
- documentation
- better api
- compile time format specification for timestamp gen (I don't want to sac any performance so need to see how difficult this would be).
- parametrizing the code to move the epoch off the Unix 1970-1-1
- benchmarking
- considering parameterizing the clocks and date to allow i128s or even i32 that would be useful with the shifted epoch code

**Things that will likely never be done**

- timezones
